### 🔹Basic Rules of "Hakoiri Musume" (The Damsel in the Box)

"Hakoiri Musume" is a classic sliding block puzzle game from Japan. It looks simple at first glance, but it’s surprisingly deep and addictive.

---

### 🔹The Rules

- The puzzle is played on a **rectangular board**, typically 5 rows by 4 columns.
- Various blocks (representing the daughter, retainers, obstacles, etc.) are placed inside the board to start.
- The blocks come in different sizes: **1×1, 1×2, 2×1, and 2×2**.
- Blocks can be **slid vertically or horizontally**, but not diagonally or by jumping.
- Blocks cannot be moved outside the board or over each other.

---

### 🔹The Goal

- The main objective is to **slide the largest block** (usually representing the "daughter" or "princess") **to the designated exit**, typically at the **bottom center** of the board.

---

### 🔹Tips for Playing

- Carefully move the smaller blocks to **make space for the large block to move**.
- The fewer moves you use, the better.
- Like a game of chess or shogi, it’s possible to get into a “deadlock” state—so **planning ahead and trial-and-error are key**.
